# Rules of the 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
I will code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.

**Start Date**  
April 28, 2017

## Additional Guidelines
- I will endeavor to tweet about my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
- If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
- I will update the [log](log.md) daily with my progress and provide a link so that others can see that progress.
- I am using this challenge as motivation to push through the [freeCodeCamp](https://beta.freecodecamp.com) full stack certification. As such, a portion of the time spent in this challenge may be spent on taking notes, which will be made available in this repo at: [Notes](notes.md)

### General ideas to make this challenge more effective
- To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each day's work in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post that you made, etc.
- If you get frustrated or stuck, give this article a read: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
- If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645)
- If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (i.e. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
